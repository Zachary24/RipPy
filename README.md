# Notes
* RipPy can be run by either a GUI or CLI, both are based on the exact same code and makeup, which means the only difference is the UI, to run the CLI version use the `cli.py` script and for the GUI version use the `gui.py` script.  
* Some providers have multiple rippers, such as instagram, which can be ripped with Instaloader or IG-Scraper
